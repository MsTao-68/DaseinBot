# Dasein-Bot （数据和代码未公开）
A repository for Dasein-Bot, namely conversational AI &amp; task-oriented AI using open-source RASA framework.
## About myself
Currently, I'm a student in senior class in Shanghai University of International Business and Economics.（本文选题任务型智能对话系统研究并进行对话场景设计，旨在为我过去的三到五年画上句号，算是完成高中时期工科学校的执念。作为一个高考数学没有及格并且转专业进大数据系的同学，在上海对外经贸大学本科四年期间是一件非常具有挑战性的事情。）
### About my knowledge and expectations
Based on my bachelor degree of Data Science and Big Data Technology, I've studied the basis of Maths of AI, including Mathematics Analysis, Probability Theory A-level, Mathamatical Statistics, Linear Algebra A-level, as well as have studied and made experiments of algorithms of AI, including traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Time Seires Analysis, etc.
In the second semester of junior year, during the process of the NLP course, I made good academic performance with the IMDB sentiment analysis project (including: ML methods, pre-trained Bert model, bert-pretrained Transformer model). Besides, I gain the general knowledge of NLP by read a few paper. I hope the after going through `Dasein-Bot project`, I will be more familiar with NLP, NLU, NLG, (Knowledge Graph if possible) and further my knowledge in chatbot in details.
## Summary of Conversational AI
As we all know, AI is becoming more and more permeated like air in our daily life. Conversational AI, one of the trending branches of AI, can provide high market values and has edges of revenue margin increase and cost reduction, 24/7 availability, personalization, etc. The mainstream of types of conversational AI, including QA bot, VQA bot (with multi-modal), Voice Assistant like Apple Siri, Social bot like Microsoft Bing Bot, Task-oriented Bot, etc. have different workflows and approaches according to their respective service line.
A chatbot can provide live conversations with users. A QA bot can provide answers to users' questions by using technologies, such as `Crawler/Spider`, `Named Entity Recognition, NER`, `Knowledge Graph, KG`, `Bert` and so on. It contains knowledge (Database/Storage of knowledge) with the integration of semantic parsing, information extraction, embedding-based method and neural methods as well as text-based categorizations and modules.
### About Dasein-Bot
Dasein-Bot is a demo a task-oriented bot using `RASA` framework, contains the following components as the whole NLP module: NLU (focusing on understanding the speech-to-text or text data of user intentions, Dialogue Manager/Dialogue State Tracking (focusing on finding the previous state and tracking the information), Action Generation (generate the actual action required from the user by algorithms) and NLG (deliver a human-friendly and readable utterance to users).
